That means I studied how people can live healthier lives, what makes it difficult, what makes it easier, how to cope with tough health situations, and how to bridge the gap between knowing what is good for you and actually doing it.</p><p>Over the last 10 years, I have come to realise something important about health that I&#39;d like to share with you. You&#39;ve probably heard the saying: &quot;A healthy person has a thousand wishes, a sick person has only one&quot;. If you think about it, being healthy is not a goal in itself, but it is the key to a thousand things that you would *really* want to do, experience, be. Being healthy is being able to enjoy your life, to look forward, to feel good - regardless of your look, regardless of any chronic health conditions you may have and regardless of any limbs you might be missing. </p><p>Being healthy means loving and caring for the body you have, doing right by it as best you can. And that of course feels good! But don&#39;t get stuck in a loop where it&#39;s all about your body and its current state. It can easily become all about &quot;fixing yourself&quot; or becoming a &quot;health nut&quot;. The gym, the blender, your trainers, macronutrients, they all have a place in life. But after dedicating some time to looking after your body, make sure to <i>use it</i>: feel the breeze, write something clever, build something awesome, make love, climb a mountain, enjoy music, spend time with people you care about, travel. <i>That&#39;s</i> what health is for.</p><p>And as long as your heart is beating, focus on the health you do have, even if it changes over the course of a lifetime.</p><p></p>","tags":["Health"]},{"title":"Intermittent fasting","slug":"intermittent-fasting","short":"The health trend that is really all about common sense and back to the roots.","long":"<h6>Fasting as part of a Challenge</h6><p>Intermittent fasting is said to bring amazing health benefits; that is why many of the Challenges ask you to abstain from calories for a span of twelve hours. It may sound drastic at first, but it’s really not that difficult, because it’s done overnight. That means, for example, if you finish dinner at 7pm, you can have <i>break-fast </i>any time after 7am the next day. Doable, right? I have found that this kind of fasting pattern works best for me. I&#39;m naturally a late breakfast-eater: it means I wait until I&#39;m actually hungy, which is rarely the case right after getting up; but even so, I don&#39;t like pushing my fasts past the point where my body tells me it&#39;s time to fuel up for the day. So what it means for me is basically just eliminating midnight-snacking and setting an incentive for earlier dinners. And honestly, it&#39;s probaby how your grandma grew up anyway and not really anything new or dubious. </p><h6>So why do it in the first place?</h6><p>Of course you can go for longer fasting periods if you like, but that is not for everyone, and 12 hours is all you need to tick the box. The main thing is that you give your body a break from digesting food all the time, so it can get to repairing and renewing more - especially the pipes and bags involved in digestion. Depending on your individual condition, this could mean fewer digestive problems, better skin, less inflammation. Oh, and it also brings down insulin levels, which means your body can finally access some of the stubborn cushy fat pillows it may have been sitting on for a while (if you have those). </p><h6>Fasting caveats</h6><p>If for any reason even 12 hours seems too much for you going without food, start out with 10 hours or less and work your way up. It should feel easy and natural after a while. Do whatever works for you, and be sure to consult a healthcare professional if you have diabetes (beware of hypoglycaemia), a history of eating disorders (it might trigger harmful old patterns) or any other condition that you are unsure about in terms of its compatibility with short periods of fasting. Also, listen to your body, and don&#39;t push through at any cost - the idea is to do yourself a favour, not chastise yourself - have an apple at hand just in case. But really, if you look at the intermittent fasting community online (there seems to be a community for anything nowadays), 12 hours is vanilla. Some might not even consider it a true fast because it&#39;s not long enough (but who cares). </p><h6>Some tips:</h6><ul><li><p>Be sure to eat well and healthy amounts during the day, so by the time you start your fast your body had a full day&#39;s worth of nourishment, and you feel satisfied. </p></li><li><p>Water and natural, calorie-free drinks like tea, coffee and herbal infusions are not only allowed during a fasting period but encouraged - to your heart&#39;s desire and beyond! </p></li><li><p>Caffeine is technically fine (as long as you take it without calories, i.e. black tea or coffee), but I found that I feel better when I pair my caffeine with calories (like plant milk or a bit of food). Also, since the bulk of my waking fast hours are in the evening, for me, caffeine during a fast is out. </p></li><li><p>A nice, warm cup of herbal tea is beautifully soothing for the stomach on a fast. My favourite for that purpose is Maharishi Ayurveda&#39;s Vata Tea. It contains liquorish root which makes it naturally sweet and does a great job of taming late night treat cravings.</p></li><li><p>Don&#39;t plan a fast when you have social dates in the calendar (meeting friends, going out, vacations...) or when you have to work late. The former will likely (and rightfully) give you FOMO and make you a buzzkill, and the latter will probably add to your stress and undermine your performance. There is a time and place for fasting, and it&#39;s not all the time everywhere. </p></li><li><p>Enjoy your fasting evenings. Kick back, watch something cool, read a good book, do something you like doing, pamper yourself, call a friend, snuggle up to someone who smells good. There are a millions  things to do in the world other than eating. Get immersed in something wonderful and forget about everything else for a while. </p></li><li><p>Enjoy your breakfast! :)</p></li></ul><p></p>","tags":["Nutrition & Hydration"]}],"pinterestHeader":"Pinterest is Awesome","pinterestLink":"https://www.pinterest.de/claraluani/the-mermaid-challenge/","pinterestFooter":"For the mermaid in your soul!"}]}}}
