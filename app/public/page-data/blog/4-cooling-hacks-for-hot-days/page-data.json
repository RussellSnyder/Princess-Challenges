What else can you do to stay cool? ","long":"<p>Summer is awesome - nature is awake, the air feels warm, your happy hormones are pumpin&#39;. At the same time, too much of a good thing can become uncomfortable: heat can mess with with your circulation and make you feel tired, lightheaded and unwell. Nobody wants that! So here&#39;s a list of hacks for you to keep your cool on a hot day. </p><h6><b>1. Hydrate with iced beverages</b></h6><p>This is so obvious, but at the same time, it does NOT go without saying - at least not in my family. I was taught that people in hot climates shun iced drinks and instead reach for tea &amp; coffee and drink their water at room-temperature, and that only uninformed tourists ask for ice. Also, we Europeans tend to use ice cubes sparingly - at least compared to our American chums. So that&#39;s what culture says.</p><p>Now <a href=\"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a9f2/f2e93c147fd8fa8a93a323dbd1d25115bb68.pdf\">Science</a>: the School of Sport &amp; Exercise Sciences at Loughborough University in England found that giving people icy cold water to drink before and during a workout in a hot room improved their workout endurance by 23% compared to those who drank the same amount of warm water. In the cold water group, body temperature and heart rate stayed lower for longer, they sweat less, and they didn&#39;t feel as hot and tired. Boom! So ice it is - at least when trying to fend off heat exhaustion. Other than that, there is nothing wrong with room temperature if that&#39;s what makes you feel cultured.</p><p>NB: If you haven&#39;t already, invest in a really well insulated water bottle. It will keep your drink cold for hours, even on sweltering days. </p><p><b></b></p><h6><b>2. Make &quot;skin mint&quot; spray</b></h6><p>I&#39;m pretty sure someone has must have come up with this before me, but as a desperate resident of a top floor flat in last year&#39;s record heat summer, I invented SKIN MINT.</p><p>To make SKIN MINT, you just fill a spray bottle with water and a few drops of essential mint oil (go easy! this is potent stuff!). Give it a good shake before spraying onto your arms, legs and back (best to avoid the face, chest and any sensitive regions). The evaporating water will cool your skin, and the menthol has an additional cooling effect that stays on once the water has gone. It feels more pronounced the more you move, as the air hits your skin. I haven&#39;t tested if it improves your training performance (maybe a new study idea, Loughborough?), but it sure feels nice. </p><p>You could even add other essential oils or perfume to personalise your SKIN MINT. Alternatively, you could add a few drops of mint oil into your body lotion.</p><p></p><h6><b>3. Make hydration lemonade</b></h6><p>In terms of hydration, nothing rivals pure and fresh water, and on a hot day, more is more. Yet, it is no secret that adding a little bit of flavour makes it even more refreshing. When you feel the heat burning into your mental clarity and physical strength, have some HYDRONADE: it&#39;s a water-heavy lemonade with cooling mint, a little natural sugar to pick you up and the smallest amount of mineral salt to replace lost electrolytes and keep the circulation going. Tastes good, too!</p><p><u>You&#39;ll need:</u></p><ul><li><p>1l of water (still or sparkling)</p></li><li><p>Juice of 1 lemon (or other citrus fruit)</p></li><li><p>1-2 teaspoons of maple syrup (optional)</p></li><li><p>1 tiny (!) pinch of Himalayan salt</p></li><li><p>Fresh mint leaves </p></li></ul><p>Mix all the ingredients together, cover tightly and let steep (ideally overnight in the fridge), then strain out the mint (or leave in if you prefer), fill into your favourite water bottle with lots of ice as per hack #1. Carry with you as a refreshing wellbeing insurance on a hot day.</p><p>Ideas for variations: infuse cucumber slices, berries or other fruit in your hydronade, or swap the mint for basil or lemon balm. If you know you have low blood pressure and can feel the heat making your circulation go lackadaisical, you could try replacing the water with iced black tea: caffeine can help constrict your blood vessels and therefore raise your blood pressure. If you want to avoid the stimulating effect of caffeine, liquorice root can also have a blood pressure raising effect, so you could try adding some chilled liquorice infusion instead - it will make your hydronade taste sweeter, too. If you don&#39;t overdo these blood pressure hacks (please don&#39;t), they might just be what the doctor ordered (but just to be clear: this is a lemonade / ice tea recipe, not medical advice.) </p><p></p><h6><b>4. Wear cotton when exercising</b></h6><p>Yes, you read right - but this is a sports hack for VERY hot days. For most of the year, your super-wicking lycra performance workout clothes are perfect, since cotton would only hold moisture (instead of wicking it) and before you know it, you&#39;re drenched in sweat. But when the thermometer hits the red region, this moisture-holding &quot;flaw&quot; of cotton becomes a strength: a wet shirt keeps you cool like no lycra can. Sexy? You decide. Depending on the heat, you could even pre-drench your shirt in water (or #2 skin mint?). But like I said, this is for working out on VERY hot days, or if you already feel overheated. Just make sure your kidneys don&#39;t get cold - maybe a cotton crop top is ideal.</p><p></p><p><b>How do you know you&#39;re overheated?</b></p><p>If it&#39;s a hot day and you&#39;re feeling dizzy, lightheaded, queasy or just plain pooped for no apparent reason, you might be experiencing heat exhaustion. Headaches, cramps, pale sweating, a fast pulse and being thirsty AF are other symptoms. In that case, get cool as fast as possible. Sit or lie down somewhere cool, maybe with your legs on a chair, drink cold water, and use water or wet towels on your skin to cool you down. If you don&#39;t feel better within 30 minutes of doing all this, get medical help (more info on heatstroke <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/heat-exhaustion-heatstroke/\">here</a>). </p><p>But ideally, don&#39;t let it come to that.
