Be inspired by what Moana and her tribe would eat, and indulge in an exotic paleo style diet bursting with the colour, flavour, protein, vitamins and minerals of clean, minimally processed foods. Perfect! Grains, dairy, soy and legumes take a backseat on some days of the challenge and are replaced with coconut or almond milk, potatoes, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, nuts and seeds. Find inspiration <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.de/claraluani/the-beach-peach-challenge/tropical-paleo/\">here</a>.</p><p>The Challenge doesn’t do “no-go’s”, so apart from what is asked of you (on days that <i>you</i> get to arrange in your calendar), there are no rules, you can eat whatever makes you feel good. Obviously, the healthier and more balanced you eat in general, the better you will look and feel, and the more of a positive change you will see by the end of it. When it comes to eating, different approaches work for different people. Whichever way you choose to put the BEACH PEACH nutrition into action, put the spotlight on the following beautiful, vibrant and glorious foods, and feel them nourish and peachify you!</p><p><b>FISH, SEAFOOD &amp; SEAWEED</b></p><p>Salmon, tuna, cod, bass, anchovies, sardines... shrimp, crab, lobster, scallops, clams, oysters, squid, octopus... nori seaweed, wakame, spirulina, chlorella... The sea was one of the main food sources for the ancient Polynesians. Why not enjoy your seafood in a Hawaiian-style poké bowl?</p><p>Also: let’s take responsibility for the impact our food choices have. When buying your seafood, look for seals of sustainable fishing (e.g. line-caught) or responsible aquafarming. Prefer sustainably wild-caught fish and shrimp where possible to save the sea horses.</p><p><b>CAROTENE-RICH VEGGIES</b></p><p>For radiant skin from the inside out, include carotene-rich veggies in your meals, like carrots, sweet potatoes and dark leafy greens like spinach and kale. Carotene is the orange colour component in those veggies that can give your skin a healthy glow and work its anti-aging, anti-inflammation, anti-cancer magic. Your body can even convert it into vitamin A, which keeps your eyes healthy and sharp for stargazing and navigating. Yes, please! </p><p>A relative of the carotene-colour is lycopene. It is the red colour in tomatoes, red peppers, guavas, watermelons and many others. Lycopene gives your skin extra strength in withstanding UV damage. So, if your’re planning on tanning the paleo way (using the good old sun), make sure you not only use sunscreen and moderation, but also “eat your reds”!</p><p><b>TROPICAL FRUIT</b></p><p>Mango, banana, guava, papaya, pineapple, dragonfruit, durian, lychee... the list goes on. Each one has its own impressive profile of nutrients and enzymes, but let’s be real, the best thing is that they taste delicious – in smoothies, fruit salads, breakfast bowls, plain or with a drizzle of coconut cream.</p><p>Talking about coconut: even though it has “nut” in the title, it is actually also a fruit. It deserves its own category though, because you can do so many different things with it – think coconut milk, cream, oil, desiccated flakes, flour... Whenever you need a substitute for those grains and dairy products you’re reducing on the BEACH PEACH Challenge, coconut is there to say: let me help!</p><p>Just one word of caution: while tropical fruit is delicious, nutrient-dense and healthy, it is also quite high in natural sugar. You may want to limit your intake to 1-2 servings every (other) day and <i>eat</i> it more often than you drink it, because juicing and blending strips away the fibre that makes you feel full, so you&#39;ll likely end up having more, and miss out on some of the best benefits. But most important: when it’s fruit o’clock, give your treat the full attention it deserves and enjoy it.</p>","tags":["Nutrition & Hydration"]}}}
