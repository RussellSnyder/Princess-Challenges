That means I studied how people can live healthier lives, what makes it difficult, what makes it easier, how to cope with tough health situations, and how to bridge the gap between knowing what is good for you and actually doing it.</p><p>Over the last 10 years, I have come to realise something important about health that I&#39;d like to share with you. You&#39;ve probably heard the saying: &quot;A healthy person has a thousand wishes, a sick person has only one&quot;. If you think about it, being healthy is not a goal in itself, but it is the key to a thousand things that you would *really* want to do, experience, be. Being healthy is being able to enjoy your life, to look forward, to feel good - regardless of your look, regardless of any chronic health conditions you may have and regardless of any limbs you might be missing. </p><p>Being healthy means loving and caring for the body you have, doing right by it as best you can. And that of course feels good! But don&#39;t get stuck in a loop where it&#39;s all about your body and its current state. It can easily become all about &quot;fixing yourself&quot; or becoming a &quot;health nut&quot;. The gym, the blender, your trainers, macronutrients, they all have a place in life. But after dedicating some time to looking after your body, make sure to <i>use it</i>: feel the breeze, write something clever, build something awesome, make love, climb a mountain, enjoy music, spend time with people you care about, travel. <i>That&#39;s</i> what health is for.</p><p>And as long as your heart is beating, focus on the health you do have, even if it changes over the course of a lifetime.</p><p></p>","tags":["Health"]}}}
