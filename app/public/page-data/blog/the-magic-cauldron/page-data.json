It is, however, an item that is strongly associated with the character it is alluding to: the witch. </p><p>Those of you who read my post about the Wise Wild Woman know how difficult it was for me to find the perfect icon for a challenge that has at its core womanhood, women&#39;s health, in a grounded, shameless, enlightened, unconventional and loving way. It was triggered by my diagnosis of endometriosis, and the insight that excruciating period pain is <i>not</i> normal. The diagnosis felt like a much-needed validation, I wasn&#39;t overly sensitive all those years, and I also wasn&#39;t &quot;unlucky&quot; with my menstruation, I was physically ill and needed appropriate medical attention (which, at last, I received, thank God). </p><p>What ensued, and is still ensuing, is a quest to keep my belly healthy, happy and endo-free, and, more broadly speaking, finding a wholesome sense of health that honours my being a woman. That process calls into question a lot of the beliefs and practices that I never really stopped to think about. Some people say we don&#39;t have to have periods to be healthy and fertile - is that true? Are bleached tampons making people sick without them knowing? What role might cannabis play in women&#39;s health? Is it true or bullshit that the moon has an impact on your cycle? Which menstruation products are actually available, though maybe not from your local drug store? Does using menstrual blood for art make you a beacon of femininity or a disgusting weirdo? What alternatives are there to painkillers? Oh, and while we&#39;re at it, is female ejaculation real?</p><p>In a mostly (but not totally) non-sexual way, all of this sparked a new interest in my female parts. The last time I felt this way, I was a teenager, being full of questions. The questions I had back then have been answered a long time ago - how to use a tampon, how to deal with period pain, how the cycle works, how to avoid pregnancy, and so on. But why stop at the basics? There is a whole world of knowledge and vagina/womb-related hacks and wisdom out there that I feel like I could have examined and experimented with a long time ago. It&#39;s time for the MAGIC CAULDRON Quest.</p><p> A magic cauldron is where interesting things are brewing, hidden from sight. It&#39;s the instrument with which the witch works her magic (and probably also cooks her soup for dinner... it&#39;s can&#39;t always be all woo woo). This quest is about caring for the cauldron so you can use it the way you please. It&#39;s also a symbol for the witch herself, the savage sage who, like I laid out before, is an image of female power and knowledge, defamed during centuries of oppressive patriarchy. The reason I didn&#39;t want to call this quest &quot;the witch challenge&quot; is because the classic fairytale witch is still strongly associated with the devil and eating children, and I want to distance myself very clearly from endorsing any and all acts of evil, occultism and related nonsense. &quot;The good witch&quot; is also not a great character name, since the modern &quot;good&quot; witch is usually a young and sexy city-dweller and therefore too far emoved from being a wise old lady in the woods - and I don&#39;t want to give up that image: a nature-dwellling, experienced, self-willed but highly peculiar woman in a cosy little hut with all sorts of outlandish things in and around it. So, I decided to stop the hunt for a character and settle for one of her signature items; incidentally, the MAGIC CAULDRON also serves as a fun metaphor for the womb and it neighbouring structures. It might even be possible to &quot;cook up&quot; a tiny human in it! If that&#39;s not magic, I don&#39;t know what is. </p><p>The MAGIC CAULDRON quest has the duration of at least one menstrual cycle, however long it may be. You can start at any point in your cycle, and it&#39;s over when you have bled twice. This way, you get time to delve into the MAGIC CAULDRON world and prepare things you want to try when your period rolls around, and then you get to consciously live through a whole cycle. You&#39;ll get to pay loving attention to your body and mind, connecting with nature and hopefully having a blast experimenting with all sorts of ways to make you enjoy your cycle more, from bud to blood. And why not? Half of all humanity lives with this cyclical process for most of their lives. If you&#39;re one of those humans, wouldn&#39;t you say it&#39;s worth checking in with on occasion? </p><p>This challenge is for you if you: </p><ul><li><p>have painful or irregular periods you want to improve</p></li><li><p>have great periods, but want to be more in tune with your cycle</p></li><li><p>like the idea of a challenge with an unapologetic adult female focus </p></li><li><p>want to try out new things &quot;down there&quot; </p></li><li><p>love fairytales and stories about witches</p></li><li><p>are interested in herbalism</p></li><li><p>love nature and science</p></li><li><p>are generally a curious woman</p></li><li><p>don&#39;t equate feminism with man-hating and bra-burning, but with giving female topics the attention they deserve and with seeing to it that being a woman is a good experience for yourself and others</p></li></ul><p>So, if you&#39;re in: let&#39;s get the fire going and show some love to that black pussy cat...</p><p></p>","tags":["Womanhood","Health"]}}}
