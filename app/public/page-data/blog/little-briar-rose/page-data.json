About calm self care, letting your body heal and restore. ","long":"<p>I created this the LITTLE BRIAR ROSE &quot;challenge&quot; at a time when I was undergoing surgery and knew I needed to give my body time, love, nourishment and good vibes for recuperating from the procedure. The challenge here was NOT to do sports, NOT to go swimming and bathing, and just focusing on the soft qualities of peaceful restoration. It can&#39;t always be &quot;all systems go&quot;, and LITTLE BRIAR ROSE is a serene celebration of that.</p><p><b>The fairytale</b></p><p>Little Briar Rose is a traditional fairytale, maybe better known to English speaking audiences as &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; - the story of a beautiful princess who gets cursed at birth to prick her finger on a spindle at the age of 15 and sleep for a hundred years. When this comes to pass, the whole country falls asleep with her, and a giant, impenetrable thicket wall of thorny rose briars grows around the castle where she lies. Many volunteers from outside the country try to battle through this hostile growth in a bid to free the sleeping princess, but they all die. Only as a century is over, the briars freely give way to a prince who comes to save the day; he kisses the sleeping beauty so she wakes up, and with her the whole country. At that point, it&#39;s happily ever after. </p><p><b>The metaphor</b></p><p>I love this fairytale as a metaphor for this challenge: no other story focuses on rest as much as this one. Of course nobody who loved her wanted this to be her fate, but after the evil curse was cast, the best that the forces of good could do for her was have her <i>rest </i>instead of perish. </p><p>The finger prick is a nice little euphemism for surgery, and the fact that the whole country sleeps alongside her can be a metaphor for the fact that if one system in your body is under the weather, this can cause ripples in your whole body and being. <i>All</i> systems deserve rest and recovery. </p><p>The rose briars might stand for the healing powers of nature, but even more for protection; beautiful but fierce guards of that rest, come what may. They defy anyone who tries to disturb her rest, but readily open up when it&#39;s time for the princess wake up again. In that sense, it&#39;s plain to see that the stereotypical hero prince wasn&#39;t really as valiant as he was lucky - or just in the right place at the right moment. And since it was time to wake up anyway, the fact that she gets woken up by a handsome guy&#39;s kiss is just a nice-to-have (wouldn&#39;t you say?). Life was kind to her and worked around that curse in the nicest possible way. That&#39;s what this challenge is about: rest, protection, and the resilience to face a health issue with calm confidence that things will get better, to not lose hope even if it takes a long time, and that the companionship and guidance you need will find you effortlessly when the time is right.</p><p>If this chymes with you, the Little Briar Rose is your perfect spirit animal for your next game. Why not bring some playfulness into your recovery ?</p>","tags":["Health","Rest & Recovery"]}}}
