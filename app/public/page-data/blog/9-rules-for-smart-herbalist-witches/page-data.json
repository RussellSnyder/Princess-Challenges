","long":"<p>The world is full of interesting plants that can be used as food or even medicine. It&#39;s exciting and fun to blend your own herbal teas, and it can be really creative and very rewarding. That said, the smart herbaliste doesn&#39;t just randomly throw stuff into the cauldrown to see what happens. The smart herbaliste knows what she&#39;s doing.</p><p>Our understanding of the medicinal properties of plants is usually based on what our ancestors have used them for, and there is often merit in the traditional uses of certain herbs after centuries of trial and error. At the same time, scientific evidence for the safety and efficacy of herbal remedies is usually scarce - most of the times, the jury is still out on whether, why and for what a herb might be useful - or dangerous. But does that mean you have to shun herbal remedies and food protocols just because your doctor didn&#39;t learn about them in medical school? No. But it does mean that you need to try things out with your head screwed on. If and when you decide to give a herbal remedies a go, I suggest these common sense safety rules:</p><ol><li><p>Do your research. Before you take anything, you should be able to answer two questions: 1) What exactly are you hoping for this herb to help you with? and 2) What are the reasons you believe this herb will do just that? In the absence of reliable, scientific sources (which are always preferable), look for traditional uses, also across cultures, like Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine. Believe those who reference good sources more than those who just have a pretty blog. Other than that, follow your gut and let common sense pave the way.</p></li><li><p>Try your best to find out if any adverse effects are expected when you take it in small or moderate amounts. Stick with herbs that are &quot;likely safe&quot;. <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/index\">WebMD</a> is a good source for a conservative, sceptical view on herbal medicines (they even dutifully point out that too much <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-960/green-tea\">green tea</a> will kill you), which can be helpful for balancing the blind, pinteresty enthusiasm about &quot;this one herb that will fix all the problems you ever had&quot;.</p></li><li><p>Not everything is good for everyone. Check if a herb you want to try is compatible with your individual constitution, especially if you have any pre-existing conditions. This is particularly true for people with blood pressure issues, autoimmune conditions and hormonal imbalances, to name a few. Not everyone benefits from blood pressure reducing, immune-boosting phytoestrogens (although some probably really do). Be extra-careful during pregnancy or when breastfeeding: if in doubt, err on the side of caution.  </p></li><li><p>Check for interactions with other drugs or supplements you might be taking. I found that the <a href=\"https://reference.medscape.com/drug-interactionchecker\">Medscape Drug Interaction Checker</a> is generally my best bet for being knowledgeable about herbal supplements, although as a whole, our knowledge about how herbs interact with pharmacy drugs and with each other is still pretty limited. Also, let your doctor know about herbs or over-the-counter meds you are taking. </p></li><li><p>Start with a small test dose and see how your body reacts over the next 2-3 days. If you feel fine, it&#39;s probably alright for you to have more of. Increase the dose slowly to the amount you see fit , but...</p></li><li><p>...always stick with amounts that can still be considered food. A cup or two of herbal infusion a day, I would say, is still food. Incorporating a herb in your meals is also obviously food. If you&#39;re taking herbs in capsules or tablets or eating amounts of it that most people would find strange, you&#39;re likely above food-amount level. Of course you can still do this, but I really would not recommend going it alone - talk it through with a doctor or a no-nonsense naturopath.</p></li><li><p>If you suspect that a herb or herbal mixture causes you discomfort: stop taking it! Don&#39;t buy into detox myths about feeling worse before you feel better. Effects like that do exist (e.g. with the treatment of <a href=\"https://patient.info/doctor/jarisch-herxheimer-reaction\">some bacterial infections</a> or during substance withdrawal), but that sort of stuff firmly belongs into professional hands. Unless you&#39;re kicking your caffeine habit, don&#39;t assume that something that feels bad is good for you. It&#39;s dangerous and not very smart. </p></li><li><p>Don&#39;t take any herbal remedy for longer than half a year without a break, even if it is just at food-amount levels, unless a doctor specifically tells you to, or gives you green light. </p></li><li><p>If you are ever in any doubt, ask a real human with real knowledge, not the internet. Looking for a good doctor or naturopath who can evaluate your individual situation, with whom you can speak openly and who understands the merits and limits of plant therapy, or even a knowledgable pharmacist, is a worthwhile endeavour. </p></li></ol><p>So much for safety. But how do you know if it&#39;s working? The scientifically minded among you might like to keep a diary that details what you took and track any health issue or performance parameter that you are taking the remedy for. This way, you can see if it actually improves with your use of the herb. The quick &amp; dirty approach is to just be vigilant and notice how you feel. Sometimes, changes can come about in baby steps, so it&#39;s good to look back and compare your situation with how it was a month, 3 months, or half a year ago.</p><p>With all that health and safety taken care of, let&#39;s get stuck in, witches!</p>","tags":["Health"]}}}
