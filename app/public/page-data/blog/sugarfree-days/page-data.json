Adding sugar to your food every day will get in the way of a hot bum and will probably also not help you with anything else you want in life. That is why most Challenges include sugar-free days.","long":"<p>I&#39;m not gonna get too deep into all the ways in which having too much sugar too often can mess with you. You know what they are, from slightly unsightly cosmetic niggles (excess weight, unclear skin...) to downright dangerous medical issues like diabetes and inflammation. No-one wants any of that, but at the same time, we&#39;re hard-wired to love that sweet taste. And that is ok! There are plenty of healthy(ish) ways to enjoy sweet foods: there is fruit, homemade cakes &amp; lemonades, good chocolate and so on. I firmly believe that a good way of eating must satisfy all your tastebuds, and even if you commit to sugar-fee days (or weeks, or longer), in the end, it is balance that wins you the game, not ascetisism. A stable weight and health will also tolerate the odd &quot;naughty&quot; sugary treat - no probs. </p><h6><u>Why have sugarfree days?</u></h6><p>What nobody gets away with untainted, though, is habitual excessive daily sugar consumption. If you&#39;re trying to get fitter, heal, or just generally feel better, sugarfree days can be very helpful. They can make you realise how much and how often you are eating sugar, and help you exercise the discipline to not always have to have it. For example, if you have a bad chocolate craving and you manage to eat a big juicy pear instead, I&#39;d call that an epic win on both the physical and psychological level. Maybe tomorrow is a non-sugarfree day, have the chocolate then. Maybe plan it so you can enjoy a treat in fun company instead of alone and in front of the telly. A little bit of well-dosed, loving discipline is a good thing, I&#39;d say. It&#39;s also good to know that your body does not need refined sugar at all. There is literally no benefit to having it (other than the nom-factor), at lots of benefit to reducing it.</p><h6><u>What counts as &quot;sugar&quot; on a sugarfree day?</u></h6><p>What counts as sugar on a sugar-free day is a blurry line – even carrots contain sugar! But if you were to sytematically NOT have anything that contains natural sugars, you&#39;d deprive yourself of some of the most healthful and delicious foods, you&#39;d diminish the variety of healthy foods you can have (and variety is awesome and important). Unless you&#39;re deliberately going for some low-carb/keto kinda thang, foregoing any and all sugars would be nonsense and counterproductive (imho). That said, if you&#39;re bingeing on fruit sugars and natural sweeteners, you&#39;re kinda missing the point, too. So for sugarfree days on the challenge, you can make up your own rules or stick with the guidelines that I set for myself and that work for me:</p><ul><li><p><b>Fresh</b> fruit doesn’t count as sugar, <b>dried</b> fruit does, because it concentrates the sugar. Yes, some types of fruit have way more sugar than others, but if you are craving mango, have some fresh mango if berries just don&#39;t hit the spot. Yes, too much fruit sugar is also quite bad, but don&#39;t break out your calculator over nutrient tables - just enjoy 1 or 2 portions a day of fruits you love and move on with your life.</p></li><li><p><b>Eating</b> fruit and veggies (like beets, carrots) doesn’t count as sugar, <b>drinking</b> them (juice, smoothies) does. This is not only because the simple act of chewing is pretty important when it comes to digestion, but also  because a lot of the fiber in the fruit gets broken down or even removed in the juicing or blending process, which means that the contained sugar hits your bloodstream faster, and you also need more to feel satisfied and full - which in turn means you&#39;ll likely consume much more sugar than you would have done eating chunks of the same type of fruit. Lemon &amp; lime juice are the obvious exception to that rule.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Honey, maple syrup, molasses, agave nectar and the likes all count as sugar. Especially the first three are usually good replacements for refined sugar in homemade cakes, sweets and drinks, but they are still very high in (naturally occuring) sugar, so having them on a sugar-free day would be cheating.</p></li><li><p>Obviously, added sugar in all its forms counts as sugar, regardless of marketing spins (“evaporated cane juice” – you‘re not fooling us!). If an ingredient ends with -ose, chances are, it&#39;s a sugar (fructose, glucose, dextrose, lactose...); if in doubt, google it. Check your bottled sauces and condiments, seasoning mixes etc, and save visits to fast food chains for another day (or for never). </p></li><li><p>On a sugar-free day, I wouldn&#39;t count the sugar naturally found in milk products (as long as there is no extra sugar added). That said, if your digestion is often sub-optimal, with stinky farts, bloating, diarrhea and so on, or if your skin is prone to breakouts, you could try leaving out dairy from your diet for a while to see if this makes a difference at all. For some people, it&#39;s precisely the dairy sugar (especially the lactose) that can cause trouble. </p></li></ul><p>Obviously, these guidelines are for people who are generally healthy. Lowering your sugar intake is a great idea for almost anyone, but maybe not <i>everyone</i>. If in doubt, talk to you doctor. That said, the sugarfree day is NOT a low-carb day, so as long as you have a healthy amount of high-quality carbohydrate-rich foods in your day, like sweet potatoes, pumpkin, potatoes, root veggies, grains and pseudograins your body likes, I would only anticipate positive effects of a sugarfree day - except maybe the infamous cravings. And the whole idea is to show those who&#39;s boss.</p><h6><u>About artifical sweeteners</u></h6><p>Humans are smart, and some smart humans think they can outsmart sugar and cheat dessert; have their cake and eat it, too; or rather, do a trick on the treat. If something seems too good to be true it usually is, and so it is with no-calorie (&quot;non-nutritive&quot;) sweeteners.</p><p>My general rule is: if a sweetener has no calories, I don&#39;t eat it. No-calorie sweeteners might save you calories the moment you eat them instead of real sugar, but they will make it harder for you to lose weight or keep it off in the long run, since <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2900484/\">they make you eat more later and drive up your insulin levels</a> (even stevia does this!). High insulin levels result in weight gain or difficulty losing it. Now, I don&#39;t want to demonise stevia, especially if it comes in its unprocessed leaf-form (I had some on my balcony in the past!); if it happens to be in a tea blend, I might just have it, although this is rare. I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to add it to my diet, and certainly not as a white powder, because it&#39;s not aligned with my goals. If I wanted to <i>gain</i> weight, I&#39;d probably use it more often.</p><p>My one true exception to my no-non-caloric sweeteners rule is liqorish root. I really enjoy the taste of it in the occasional cup of herbal infusion, but up until writing this blog post, I never thought of it as a sugar replacement. It pretty much never takes that role since it has such a strong taste of its own. I don&#39;t know if it also has the insulin-raising effect that stevia has, I couldn&#39;t find any evidence for or against that. But it stands to reason that it might. Either way, anyone should consume liquorish in moderation to avoid side effects, but unless you binge on it or take supplements, a little bit here and there is &quot;<a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-881/licorice\">likely safe for most people</a>&quot;<a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-881/licorice\"></a>. You get to make your own decisions about what works for you (and whether you like the taste in the first place)!</p><p>Xylitol and other sugar alcohols seem popular in the low carb / keto scene. They occur naturally in some fruits and plants in small quantities. However, extracting them as white powder makes them a processed sweetener, too, and consuming that powder in large quantities to replace sugar seems to cause <a href=\"https://crunchybetty.com/xylitol-should-we-stop-calling-it-natural/\">digestive trouble</a> for some - in fact, all no-calorie sweeteners seem to have a laxative effect if you only have a large enough amount. There is also controversy with how xylitol &amp; co. are made, but I don&#39;t want to get into that. For myself, I have decided not to bother with sugar alcohols. You might feel different.</p><p>One thing, though, is pretty clear to me: artificial sweeteners (aspartame, acesulfame &amp; friends) are bad; <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5617129/\">aspartame might make you feel depressed</a>, and that&#39;s not even all. If you search through scientific publications, you&#39;ll find plenty more cause for concern, but honestly, who cares about the details? Just don&#39;t have them and be happy. I find this particularly easy since I think they taste repulsive, too. &quot;No added sugar&quot; on a label can be code for &quot;lots of added sweeteners&quot;. Also,  if a product proudly presents itself as <i>Diet</i> or <i>Light</i>, be wary. It&#39;s likely part of the scam that has obesity rates soaring. Instead, join team &quot;real deal&quot; and enjoy your sugar in healthy moderation, from good sources and without shame.</p><h6><u>How to make sugarfree days easy on yourself</u></h6><ul><li><p>You may find that one sugar-free day at a time is not enough to make sugar cravings subside. Some people might do better with a string of sugar-free days, while for others it might be helpful to know that it is just a day (and you can do anything for a day). </p></li><li><p>You could also try to reduce sugar first on a non-sugarfree day, or you go cold turkey on the day. </p></li><li><p>You could distract yourself with work, sports, TV or anything that your mind enjoys falling into.</p></li><li><p>If it&#39;s an afternoon pick-me-up that you&#39;re looking for, try a little cup of green or black tea, some fruit, fresh air or even a nap (if you can). Experienced yogis can do a round of &quot;breath of fire&quot; pranayama to flood the body with oxygen. </p></li><li><p>Late night cravings might responds to a relaxing bath or shower, a cup of warm (almond) milk</p></li><li><p>Another helpful tool could be mindfulness - paying attention to your cravings, and being fully present and basking in the enjoyment of eating a piece of fruit, savouring its sweetness and flavour. </p></li></ul><p>Try it out and see what works for you!</p>","tags":["Nutrition & Hydration"]}}}
