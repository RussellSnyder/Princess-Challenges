Adding sugar to your food every day will get in the way of a hot bum and will probably also not help you with anything else you want in life. That is why most Challenges include sugar-free days.","long":"<p>I&#39;m not gonna get too deep into all the ways in which having too much sugar too often can mess with you. You know what they are, from slightly unsightly cosmetic niggles (excess weight, unclear skin...) to downright dangerous medical issues like diabetes and inflammation. No-one wants any of that, but at the same time, we&#39;re hard-wired to love that sweet taste. And that is ok! There are plenty of healthy(ish) ways to enjoy sweet foods: there is fruit, homemade cakes &amp; lemonades, good chocolate and so on. I firmly believe that a good way of eating must satisfy all your tastebuds, and even if you commit to sugar-fee days (or weeks, or longer), in the end, it is balance that wins you the game, not ascetisism. A stable weight and health will also tolerate the odd &quot;naughty&quot; sugary treat - no probs. </p><h6><u>Why have sugarfree days?</u></h6><p>What nobody gets away with untainted, though, is habitual excessive daily sugar consumption. If you&#39;re trying to get fitter, heal, or just generally feel better, sugarfree days can be very helpful. They can make you realise how much and how often you are eating sugar, and help you exercise the discipline to not always have to have it. For example, if you have a bad chocolate craving and you manage to eat a big juicy pear instead, I&#39;d call that an epic win on both the physical and psychological level. Maybe tomorrow is a non-sugarfree day, have the chocolate then. Maybe plan it so you can enjoy a treat in fun company instead of alone and in front of the telly. A little bit of well-dosed, loving discipline is a good thing, I&#39;d say. It&#39;s also good to know that your body does not need refined sugar at all. There is literally no benefit to having it (other than the nom-factor), at lots of benefit to reducing it.</p><h6><u>What counts as &quot;sugar&quot; on a sugarfree day?</u></h6><p>What counts as sugar on a sugar-free day is a blurry line – even carrots contain sugar! But if you were to sytematically NOT have anything that contains natural sugars, you&#39;d deprive yourself of some of the most healthful and delicious foods, you&#39;d diminish the variety of healthy foods you can have (and variety is awesome and important). Unless you&#39;re deliberately going for some low-carb/keto kinda thang, foregoing any and all sugars would be nonsense and counterproductive (imho). That said, if you&#39;re bingeing on fruit sugars and natural sweeteners, you&#39;re kinda missing the point, too. So for sugarfree days on the challenge, you can make up your own rules or stick with the guidelines that I set for myself and that work for me:</p><ul><li><p><b>Fresh</b> fruit doesn’t count as sugar, <b>dried</b> fruit does, because it concentrates the sugar. Yes, some types of fruit have way more sugar than others, but if you are craving mango, have some fresh mango if berries just don&#39;t hit the spot. Yes, too much fruit sugar is also quite bad, but don&#39;t break out your calculator over nutrient tables - just enjoy 1 or 2 portions a day of fruits you love and move on with your life.</p></li><li><p><b>Eating</b> fruit and veggies (like beets, carrots) doesn’t count as sugar, <b>drinking</b> them (juice, smoothies) does. This is not only because the simple act of chewing is pretty important when it comes to digestion, but also  because a lot of the fiber in the fruit gets broken down or even removed in the juicing or blending process, which means that the contained sugar hits your bloodstream faster, and you also need more to feel satisfied and full - which in turn means you&#39;ll likely consume much more sugar than you would have done eating chunks of the same type of fruit. Lemon &amp; lime juice are the obvious exception to that rule.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Honey, maple syrup, molasses, agave nectar and the likes all count as sugar. Especially the first three are usually good replacements for refined sugar in homemade cakes, sweets and drinks, but they are still very high in (naturally occuring) sugar, so having them on a sugar-free day would be cheating.</p></li><li><p>Obviously, added sugar in all its forms counts as sugar, regardless of marketing spins (“evaporated cane juice” – you‘re not fooling us!). If an ingredient ends with -ose, chances are, it&#39;s a sugar (fructose, glucose, dextrose, lactose...); if in doubt, google it. Check your bottled sauces and condiments, seasoning mixes etc, and save visits to fast food chains for another day (or for never). </p></li><li><p>On a sugar-free day, I wouldn&#39;t count the sugar naturally found in milk products (as long as there is no extra sugar added). That said, if your digestion is often sub-optimal, with stinky farts, bloating, diarrhea and so on, or if your skin is prone to breakouts, you could try leaving out dairy from your diet for a while to see if this makes a difference at all. For some people, it&#39;s precisely the dairy sugar (especially the lactose) that can cause trouble. </p></li></ul><p>Obviously, these guidelines are for people who are generally healthy. Lowering your sugar intake is a great idea for almost anyone, but maybe not <i>everyone</i>. If in doubt, talk to you doctor. That said, the sugarfree day is NOT a low-carb day, so as long as you have a healthy amount of high-quality carbohydrate-rich foods in your day, like sweet potatoes, pumpkin, potatoes, root veggies, grains and pseudograins your body likes, I would only anticipate positive effects of a sugarfree day - except maybe the infamous cravings. And the whole idea is to show those who&#39;s boss.</p><h6><u>About artifical sweeteners</u></h6><p>Humans are smart, and some smart humans think they can outsmart sugar and cheat dessert; have their cake and eat it, too; or rather, do a trick on the treat. If something seems too good to be true it usually is, and so it is with no-calorie (&quot;non-nutritive&quot;) sweeteners.</p><p>My general rule is: if a sweetener has no calories, I don&#39;t eat it. No-calorie sweeteners might save you calories the moment you eat them instead of real sugar, but they will make it harder for you to lose weight or keep it off in the long run, since <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2900484/\">they make you eat more later and drive up your insulin levels</a> (even stevia does this!). High insulin levels result in weight gain or difficulty losing it. Now, I don&#39;t want to demonise stevia, especially if it comes in its unprocessed leaf-form (I had some on my balcony in the past!); if it happens to be in a tea blend, I might just have it, although this is rare. I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to add it to my diet, and certainly not as a white powder, because it&#39;s not aligned with my goals. If I wanted to <i>gain</i> weight, I&#39;d probably use it more often.</p><p>My one true exception to my no-non-caloric sweeteners rule is liqorish root. I really enjoy the taste of it in the occasional cup of herbal infusion, but up until writing this blog post, I never thought of it as a sugar replacement. It pretty much never takes that role since it has such a strong taste of its own. I don&#39;t know if it also has the insulin-raising effect that stevia has, I couldn&#39;t find any evidence for or against that. But it stands to reason that it might. Either way, anyone should consume liquorish in moderation to avoid side effects, but unless you binge on it or take supplements, a little bit here and there is &quot;<a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-881/licorice\">likely safe for most people</a>&quot;<a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-881/licorice\"></a>. You get to make your own decisions about what works for you (and whether you like the taste in the first place)!</p><p>Xylitol and other sugar alcohols seem popular in the low carb / keto scene. They occur naturally in some fruits and plants in small quantities. However, extracting them as white powder makes them a processed sweetener, too, and consuming that powder in large quantities to replace sugar seems to cause <a href=\"https://crunchybetty.com/xylitol-should-we-stop-calling-it-natural/\">digestive trouble</a> for some - in fact, all no-calorie sweeteners seem to have a laxative effect if you only have a large enough amount. There is also controversy with how xylitol &amp; co. are made, but I don&#39;t want to get into that. For myself, I have decided not to bother with sugar alcohols. You might feel different.</p><p>One thing, though, is pretty clear to me: artificial sweeteners (aspartame, acesulfame &amp; friends) are bad; <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5617129/\">aspartame might make you feel depressed</a>, and that&#39;s not even all. If you search through scientific publications, you&#39;ll find plenty more cause for concern, but honestly, who cares about the details? Just don&#39;t have them and be happy. I find this particularly easy since I think they taste repulsive, too. &quot;No added sugar&quot; on a label can be code for &quot;lots of added sweeteners&quot;. Also,  if a product proudly presents itself as <i>Diet</i> or <i>Light</i>, be wary. It&#39;s likely part of the scam that has obesity rates soaring. Instead, join team &quot;real deal&quot; and enjoy your sugar in healthy moderation, from good sources and without shame.</p><h6><u>How to make sugarfree days easy on yourself</u></h6><ul><li><p>You may find that one sugar-free day at a time is not enough to make sugar cravings subside. Some people might do better with a string of sugar-free days, while for others it might be helpful to know that it is just a day (and you can do anything for a day). </p></li><li><p>You could also try to reduce sugar first on a non-sugarfree day, or you go cold turkey on the day. </p></li><li><p>You could distract yourself with work, sports, TV or anything that your mind enjoys falling into.</p></li><li><p>If it&#39;s an afternoon pick-me-up that you&#39;re looking for, try a little cup of green or black tea, some fruit, fresh air or even a nap (if you can). Experienced yogis can do a round of &quot;breath of fire&quot; pranayama to flood the body with oxygen. </p></li><li><p>Late night cravings might responds to a relaxing bath or shower, a cup of warm (almond) milk</p></li><li><p>Another helpful tool could be mindfulness - paying attention to your cravings, and being fully present and basking in the enjoyment of eating a piece of fruit, savouring its sweetness and flavour. </p></li></ul><p>Try it out and see what works for you!</p>","tags":["Nutrition & Hydration"]},{"title":"LITTLE BRIAR ROSE","slug":"little-briar-rose","short":"While the other challenges aim to make you more active and getting \"out there\", this one is about recovery. About calm self care, letting your body heal and restore. ","long":"<p>I created this the LITTLE BRIAR ROSE &quot;challenge&quot; at a time when I was undergoing surgery and knew I needed to give my body time, love, nourishment and good vibes for recuperating from the procedure. The challenge here was NOT to do sports, NOT to go swimming and bathing, and just focusing on the soft qualities of peaceful restoration. It can&#39;t always be &quot;all systems go&quot;, and LITTLE BRIAR ROSE is a serene celebration of that.</p><p><b>The fairytale</b></p><p>Little Briar Rose is a traditional fairytale, maybe better known to English speaking audiences as &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; - the story of a beautiful princess who gets cursed at birth to prick her finger on a spindle at the age of 15 and sleep for a hundred years. When this comes to pass, the whole country falls asleep with her, and a giant, impenetrable thicket wall of thorny rose briars grows around the castle where she lies. Many volunteers from outside the country try to battle through this hostile growth in a bid to free the sleeping princess, but they all die. Only as a century is over, the briars freely give way to a prince who comes to save the day; he kisses the sleeping beauty so she wakes up, and with her the whole country. At that point, it&#39;s happily ever after. </p><p><b>The metaphor</b></p><p>I love this fairytale as a metaphor for this challenge: no other story focuses on rest as much as this one. Of course nobody who loved her wanted this to be her fate, but after the evil curse was cast, the best that the forces of good could do for her was have her <i>rest </i>instead of perish. </p><p>The finger prick is a nice little euphemism for surgery, and the fact that the whole country sleeps alongside her can be a metaphor for the fact that if one system in your body is under the weather, this can cause ripples in your whole body and being. <i>All</i> systems deserve rest and recovery. </p><p>The rose briars might stand for the healing powers of nature, but even more for protection; beautiful but fierce guards of that rest, come what may. They defy anyone who tries to disturb her rest, but readily open up when it&#39;s time for the princess wake up again. In that sense, it&#39;s plain to see that the stereotypical hero prince wasn&#39;t really as valiant as he was lucky - or just in the right place at the right moment. And since it was time to wake up anyway, the fact that she gets woken up by a handsome guy&#39;s kiss is just a nice-to-have (wouldn&#39;t you say?). Life was kind to her and worked around that curse in the nicest possible way. That&#39;s what this challenge is about: rest, protection, and the resilience to face a health issue with calm confidence that things will get better, to not lose hope even if it takes a long time, and that the companionship and guidance you need will find you effortlessly when the time is right.</p><p>If this chymes with you, the Little Briar Rose is your perfect spirit animal for your next game.

What else can you do to stay cool? ","long":"<p>Summer is awesome - nature is awake, the air feels warm, your happy hormones are pumpin&#39;. At the same time, too much of a good thing can become uncomfortable: heat can mess with with your circulation and make you feel tired, lightheaded and unwell. Nobody wants that! So here&#39;s a list of hacks for you to keep your cool on a hot day. </p><h6><b>1. Hydrate with iced beverages</b></h6><p>This is so obvious, but at the same time, it does NOT go without saying - at least not in my family. I was taught that people in hot climates shun iced drinks and instead reach for tea &amp; coffee and drink their water at room-temperature, and that only uninformed tourists ask for ice. Also, we Europeans tend to use ice cubes sparingly - at least compared to our American chums. So that&#39;s what culture says.</p><p>Now <a href=\"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a9f2/f2e93c147fd8fa8a93a323dbd1d25115bb68.pdf\">Science</a>: the School of Sport &amp; Exercise Sciences at Loughborough University in England found that giving people icy cold water to drink before and during a workout in a hot room improved their workout endurance by 23% compared to those who drank the same amount of warm water. In the cold water group, body temperature and heart rate stayed lower for longer, they sweat less, and they didn&#39;t feel as hot and tired. Boom! So ice it is - at least when trying to fend off heat exhaustion. Other than that, there is nothing wrong with room temperature if that&#39;s what makes you feel cultured.</p><p>NB: If you haven&#39;t already, invest in a really well insulated water bottle. It will keep your drink cold for hours, even on sweltering days. </p><p><b></b></p><h6><b>2. Make &quot;skin mint&quot; spray</b></h6><p>I&#39;m pretty sure someone has must have come up with this before me, but as a desperate resident of a top floor flat in last year&#39;s record heat summer, I invented SKIN MINT.</p><p>To make SKIN MINT, you just fill a spray bottle with water and a few drops of essential mint oil (go easy! this is potent stuff!). Give it a good shake before spraying onto your arms, legs and back (best to avoid the face, chest and any sensitive regions). The evaporating water will cool your skin, and the menthol has an additional cooling effect that stays on once the water has gone. It feels more pronounced the more you move, as the air hits your skin. I haven&#39;t tested if it improves your training performance (maybe a new study idea, Loughborough?), but it sure feels nice. </p><p>You could even add other essential oils or perfume to personalise your SKIN MINT. Alternatively, you could add a few drops of mint oil into your body lotion.</p><p></p><h6><b>3. Make hydration lemonade</b></h6><p>In terms of hydration, nothing rivals pure and fresh water, and on a hot day, more is more. Yet, it is no secret that adding a little bit of flavour makes it even more refreshing. When you feel the heat burning into your mental clarity and physical strength, have some HYDRONADE: it&#39;s a water-heavy lemonade with cooling mint, a little natural sugar to pick you up and the smallest amount of mineral salt to replace lost electrolytes and keep the circulation going. Tastes good, too!</p><p><u>You&#39;ll need:</u></p><ul><li><p>1l of water (still or sparkling)</p></li><li><p>Juice of 1 lemon (or other citrus fruit)</p></li><li><p>1-2 teaspoons of maple syrup (optional)</p></li><li><p>1 tiny (!) pinch of Himalayan salt</p></li><li><p>Fresh mint leaves </p></li></ul><p>Mix all the ingredients together, cover tightly and let steep (ideally overnight in the fridge), then strain out the mint (or leave in if you prefer), fill into your favourite water bottle with lots of ice as per hack #1. Carry with you as a refreshing wellbeing insurance on a hot day.</p><p>Ideas for variations: infuse cucumber slices, berries or other fruit in your hydronade, or swap the mint for basil or lemon balm. If you know you have low blood pressure and can feel the heat making your circulation go lackadaisical, you could try replacing the water with iced black tea: caffeine can help constrict your blood vessels and therefore raise your blood pressure. If you want to avoid the stimulating effect of caffeine, liquorice root can also have a blood pressure raising effect, so you could try adding some chilled liquorice infusion instead - it will make your hydronade taste sweeter, too. If you don&#39;t overdo these blood pressure hacks (please don&#39;t), they might just be what the doctor ordered (but just to be clear: this is a lemonade / ice tea recipe, not medical advice.) </p><p></p><h6><b>4. Wear cotton when exercising</b></h6><p>Yes, you read right - but this is a sports hack for VERY hot days. For most of the year, your super-wicking lycra performance workout clothes are perfect, since cotton would only hold moisture (instead of wicking it) and before you know it, you&#39;re drenched in sweat. But when the thermometer hits the red region, this moisture-holding &quot;flaw&quot; of cotton becomes a strength: a wet shirt keeps you cool like no lycra can. Sexy? You decide. Depending on the heat, you could even pre-drench your shirt in water (or #2 skin mint?). But like I said, this is for working out on VERY hot days, or if you already feel overheated. Just make sure your kidneys don&#39;t get cold - maybe a cotton crop top is ideal.</p><p></p><p><b>How do you know you&#39;re overheated?</b></p><p>If it&#39;s a hot day and you&#39;re feeling dizzy, lightheaded, queasy or just plain pooped for no apparent reason, you might be experiencing heat exhaustion. Headaches, cramps, pale sweating, a fast pulse and being thirsty AF are other symptoms. In that case, get cool as fast as possible. Sit or lie down somewhere cool, maybe with your legs on a chair, drink cold water, and use water or wet towels on your skin to cool you down. If you don&#39;t feel better within 30 minutes of doing all this, get medical help (more info on heatstroke <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/heat-exhaustion-heatstroke/\">here</a>). </p><p>But ideally, don&#39;t let it come to that.

You&#39;ve probably heard the saying: &quot;A healthy person has a thousand wishes, a sick person has only one&quot;. If you think about it, being healthy is not a goal in itself, but it is the key to a thousand things that you would *really* want to do, experience, be. Being healthy is being able to enjoy your life, to look forward, to feel good - regardless of your look, regardless of any chronic health conditions you may have and regardless of any limbs you might be missing. </p><p>Being healthy means loving and caring for the body you have, doing right by it as best you can. And that of course feels good! But don&#39;t get stuck in a loop where it&#39;s all about your body and its current state. It can easily become all about &quot;fixing yourself&quot; or becoming a &quot;health nut&quot;. The gym, the blender, your trainers, macronutrients, they all have a place in life. But after dedicating some time to looking after your body, make sure to <i>use it</i>: feel the breeze, write something clever, build something awesome, make love, climb a mountain, enjoy music, spend time with people you care about, travel. <i>That&#39;s</i> what health is for.</p><p>And as long as your heart is beating, focus on the health you do have, even if it changes over the course of a lifetime.</p><p></p>","tags":["Health"]},{"title":"THE MAGIC CAULDRON","slug":"the-magic-cauldron","short":"A quest for better periods, more conscious cycles, sexual and reproductive health, new horizons, and a sense of wellbeing & loving your life as a woman.","long":"<p>This is the first challenge that does not have a character at its core, but an item. It is, however, an item that is strongly associated with the character it is alluding to: the witch. </p><p>Those of you who read my post about the Wise Wild Woman know how difficult it was for me to find the perfect icon for a challenge that has at its core womanhood, women&#39;s health, in a grounded, shameless, enlightened, unconventional and loving way. It was triggered by my diagnosis of endometriosis, and the insight that excruciating period pain is <i>not</i> normal. The diagnosis felt like a much-needed validation, I wasn&#39;t overly sensitive all those years, and I also wasn&#39;t &quot;unlucky&quot; with my menstruation, I was physically ill and needed appropriate medical attention (which, at last, I received, thank God). </p><p>What ensued, and is still ensuing, is a quest to keep my belly healthy, happy and endo-free, and, more broadly speaking, finding a wholesome sense of health that honours my being a woman. That process calls into question a lot of the beliefs and practices that I never really stopped to think about. Some people say we don&#39;t have to have periods to be healthy and fertile - is that true? Are bleached tampons making people sick without them knowing? What role might cannabis play in women&#39;s health? Is it true or bullshit that the moon has an impact on your cycle? Which menstruation products are actually available, though maybe not from your local drug store? Does using menstrual blood for art make you a beacon of femininity or a disgusting weirdo? What alternatives are there to painkillers? Oh, and while we&#39;re at it, is female ejaculation real?</p><p>In a mostly (but not totally) non-sexual way, all of this sparked a new interest in my female parts. The last time I felt this way, I was a teenager, being full of questions. The questions I had back then have been answered a long time ago - how to use a tampon, how to deal with period pain, how the cycle works, how to avoid pregnancy, and so on. But why stop at the basics? There is a whole world of knowledge and vagina/womb-related hacks and wisdom out there that I feel like I could have examined and experimented with a long time ago. It&#39;s time for the MAGIC CAULDRON Quest.</p><p> A magic cauldron is where interesting things are brewing, hidden from sight. It&#39;s the instrument with which the witch works her magic (and probably also cooks her soup for dinner... it&#39;s can&#39;t always be all woo woo). This quest is about caring for the cauldron so you can use it the way you please. It&#39;s also a symbol for the witch herself, the savage sage who, like I laid out before, is an image of female power and knowledge, defamed during centuries of oppressive patriarchy. The reason I didn&#39;t want to call this quest &quot;the witch challenge&quot; is because the classic fairytale witch is still strongly associated with the devil and eating children, and I want to distance myself very clearly from endorsing any and all acts of evil, occultism and related nonsense. &quot;The good witch&quot; is also not a great character name, since the modern &quot;good&quot; witch is usually a young and sexy city-dweller and therefore too far emoved from being a wise old lady in the woods - and I don&#39;t want to give up that image: a nature-dwellling, experienced, self-willed but highly peculiar woman in a cosy little hut with all sorts of outlandish things in and around it. So, I decided to stop the hunt for a character and settle for one of her signature items; incidentally, the MAGIC CAULDRON also serves as a fun metaphor for the womb and it neighbouring structures. It might even be possible to &quot;cook up&quot; a tiny human in it! If that&#39;s not magic, I don&#39;t know what is. </p><p>The MAGIC CAULDRON quest has the duration of at least one menstrual cycle, however long it may be. You can start at any point in your cycle, and it&#39;s over when you have bled twice. This way, you get time to delve into the MAGIC CAULDRON world and prepare things you want to try when your period rolls around, and then you get to consciously live through a whole cycle. You&#39;ll get to pay loving attention to your body and mind, connecting with nature and hopefully having a blast experimenting with all sorts of ways to make you enjoy your cycle more, from bud to blood. And why not? Half of all humanity lives with this cyclical process for most of their lives. If you&#39;re one of those humans, wouldn&#39;t you say it&#39;s worth checking in with on occasion? </p><p>This challenge is for you if you: </p><ul><li><p>have painful or irregular periods you want to improve</p></li><li><p>have great periods, but want to be more in tune with your cycle</p></li><li><p>like the idea of a challenge with an unapologetic adult female focus </p></li><li><p>want to try out new things &quot;down there&quot; </p></li><li><p>love fairytales and stories about witches</p></li><li><p>are interested in herbalism</p></li><li><p>love nature and science</p></li><li><p>are generally a curious woman</p></li><li><p>don&#39;t equate feminism with man-hating and bra-burning, but with giving female topics the attention they deserve and with seeing to it that being a woman is a good experience for yourself and others</p></li></ul><p>So, if you&#39;re in: let&#39;s get the fire going and show some love to that black pussy cat...</p><p></p>","tags":["Womanhood","Health"]},{"title":"Tropical Paleo","slug":"tropical-paleo","short":"Nutrition on the BEACH PEACH Challenge","long":"<p>Seafood, tropical fruit and skin-enhancing veggies are the stars of Beach Peach Challenge.

Your body can even convert it into vitamin A, which keeps your eyes healthy and sharp for stargazing and navigating. Yes, please! </p><p>A relative of the carotene-colour is lycopene. It is the red colour in tomatoes, red peppers, guavas, watermelons and many others. Lycopene gives your skin extra strength in withstanding UV damage. So, if your’re planning on tanning the paleo way (using the good old sun), make sure you not only use sunscreen and moderation, but also “eat your reds”!</p><p><b>TROPICAL FRUIT</b></p><p>Mango, banana, guava, papaya, pineapple, dragonfruit, durian, lychee... the list goes on. Each one has its own impressive profile of nutrients and enzymes, but let’s be real, the best thing is that they taste delicious – in smoothies, fruit salads, breakfast bowls, plain or with a drizzle of coconut cream.</p><p>Talking about coconut: even though it has “nut” in the title, it is actually also a fruit. It deserves its own category though, because you can do so many different things with it – think coconut milk, cream, oil, desiccated flakes, flour... Whenever you need a substitute for those grains and dairy products you’re reducing on the BEACH PEACH Challenge, coconut is there to say: let me help!</p><p>Just one word of caution: while tropical fruit is delicious, nutrient-dense and healthy, it is also quite high in natural sugar. You may want to limit your intake to 1-2 servings every (other) day and <i>eat</i> it more often than you drink it, because juicing and blending strips away the fibre that makes you feel full, so you&#39;ll likely end up having more, and miss out on some of the best benefits. But most important: when it’s fruit o’clock, give your treat the full attention it deserves and enjoy it.</p>","tags":["Nutrition & Hydration"]},{"title":"Intermittent fasting","slug":"intermittent-fasting","short":"The health trend that is really all about common sense and back to the roots.","long":"<h6>Fasting as part of a Challenge</h6><p>Intermittent fasting (IM) is said to bring amazing <a href=\"https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/intermittent-fasting/\">health benefits</a>; that is why many of the Challenges ask you to abstain from calories for a span of twelve hours - which is a short, rather &quot;mild&quot; form of IM. Even so, it may sound drastic at first, but it’s really not that difficult, because it’s done overnight. That means, for example, if you finish dinner at 7pm, you can have <i>break-fast </i>any time after 7am the next day. Doable, right? I have found that that kind of fasting pattern works best for me. I&#39;m naturally a late breakfast-eater: it means I wait until I&#39;m actually hungy, which is rarely the case right after getting up; but even so, I don&#39;t like pushing my fasts past the point where my body tells me it&#39;s time to fuel up for the day. So what it means for me is basically just eliminating midnight-snacking and setting an incentive for earlier dinners. And honestly, it&#39;s probaby how your great-grandma lived anyway, without calling it fancy names or or making a big hoo-ha about it. In that sense, a 12-hour fast is not really anything new or dubious. You can go for longer fasting periods if you like, but that is not for everyone, and 12 hours is all you need to tick the box in the challenge.</p><h6>So why do it in the first place?</h6><p>The main reason for doing IM is to you give your body a break from digesting food all the time, so it can get to repairing and renewing more - especially the pipes and bags involved in digestion. Depending on your individual condition, this could mean fewer digestive problems, better skin, less inflammation. Oh, and it can also bring down insulin levels, which means your body can finally access some of the stubborn cushy fat pillows it may have been sitting on for a while (if you have those). </p><h6>Fasting caveats</h6><p>If for any reason even 12 hours of going without food seems too much for you, start out with 10 hours or less and work your way up. It should feel easy and natural after a while. Do whatever works for you, and be sure to consult a healthcare professional if you have diabetes (beware of hypoglycaemia), a history of eating disorders (it might trigger harmful old patterns) or any other condition that you are unsure about in terms of its compatibility with short periods of fasting. Also, listen to your body, and don&#39;t push through at any cost - the idea is to do yourself a favour, not chastise yourself - have an apple at hand just in case. But really, if you look at the intermittent fasting community online (there seems to be a community for anything nowadays), 12 hours is vanilla. Some might not even consider it a true fast because it&#39;s not long enough (but who cares). </p><h6>Some tips:</h6><ul><li><p>Be sure to eat well and healthy amounts during the day, so by the time you start your fast your body had a full day&#39;s worth of nourishment, and you feel satisfied. </p></li><li><p>Water and natural, calorie-free drinks like (herbal) tea are not only allowed during a fasting period but encouraged - hydrate to your heart&#39;s (and body&#39;s) desire! </p></li><li><p>Caffeine is technically fine (as long as you take it without calories, i.e. black tea or coffee), but I found that I feel better when I pair my caffeine with calories (like plant milk or a bit of food). Also, since the bulk of my waking fast hours are in the evening, for me, caffeine during a fast is out. </p></li><li><p>A nice, warm cup of herbal tea is beautifully soothing for the stomach on a fast. My favourite for that purpose is Maharishi Ayurveda&#39;s Vata Tea. It contains liquorish root which makes it naturally sweet and does a great job of taming late night treat cravings.</p></li><li><p>Don&#39;t plan a fast when you have social dates in the calendar (meeting friends, going out, vacations...) or when you have to work late. The former will likely (and rightfully) give you FOMO and make you a buzzkill, and the latter will probably add to your stress and undermine your performance. There is a time and place for fasting, and it&#39;s not all the time everywhere. </p></li><li><p>Enjoy your fasting evenings. Kick back, watch something cool, read a good book, do something you like doing, pamper yourself, call a friend, snuggle up to someone who smells good. There are a millions  things to do in the world other than eating. Get immersed in something wonderful and forget about everything else for a while. </p></li><li><p>Enjoy your breakfast! :)</p></li></ul><p></p>","tags":["Nutrition & Hydration"]},{"title":"Beauty is a balancing act","slug":"beauty-is-a-balancing-act","short":"Why wanting to be conventionally pretty is quite alright - but not at any cost.","long":"<p>What counts as beautiful changes all the time. I&#39;m not even talking about shoulder pads, mom pants, perms and plateau shoes: even a few years back, the stereotypical phrase for a woman trying on new clothes was a fearful &quot;does my ass look big in this?&quot; A few years later it seems asses can&#39;t be big enough.</p><p>\nQueen Elizabeth the First wanted to be pale AF and didn&#39;t like the idea of eyebrows. So off with the unsightly caterpillars and on with the skin-eating, cancer-causing white lead face paint. Nowadays, a bronzed glow and rather impressive eyebrows are en vogue, so on with the spray tan and dark eyebrow powders. It seems that beauty is whatever we all agree it is, as longs as it takes some doing for most people. Maybe that&#39;s one reason why hairy legs are not bound to make a comeback in mainstream beauty anytime soon - it would be too easy. </p><p>\nUsually, beauty standards are dictated by style icons like Elizabeth I or Kim K, if their contemporaries view them as copy-worthy. It has something to do with social status; the moment you realise this, you understand: beauty is not all that eternal, but really more of a social concept. It may be rooted in some genetically encoded preferences (looking young, fertile, healthy, strong), but how these attributes are being signalled can - and does - change over time and with location. </p><p>\nI know that being hairless, big-lipped, big-hipped, with a flat tummy, toned limbs, shiny hair and silky skin is all very &quot;now&quot;. I can reject this and pretend to live in a Peter Paul Rubens painting, and Lord knows I&#39;ve tried that approach. But we are all social creatures in a social context, whether we like it or not. I have realised this: even though I understand beauty standards are arbitrary, I cannot easily change them in my head. I, too, like the look of smooth skin, big lips and the rest, even if my feminist side gives me gip for it. Yes, I can grow my leg hair out and strut my dimply thighs in a miniskirt. But at best - and I am speaking only for myself - I can arrive at a place of &quot;I don&#39;t care what people think&quot;. I can&#39;t help it, I feel prettier with smooth skin on my legs. This is the way of my society, and I am a part of it. </p><p>But does this mean I obsess over the differences between my body and that of a photoshopped model or instagram starlet? HELL NO. I am a social being, yes, but I am also an individual with respect for my own unique body. I am also more than just my looks; sometimes life gets in the way of shaving and grooming, and I don&#39;t have to be perfect all the time. Even though I know my preferences are inextricably imbued by the preferences of my society, I still get to make some choices. It was never a goal of mine to look like a model. I even find the goal of &quot;my best self&quot; too much pressure. Instead, I reframed beauty for myself into <b>body confidence</b>. Knowing that beauty emanates from health and state of mind, and that all the rest is just trimmings. For me, it means balancing happily on a fine line, right where the pressure of unrealistic billboard perfection clashes with the pressure of feminist empowerment (&quot;You should feel beautiful regardless of what you look like! Why don&#39;t you?! Why do you give into their norms?!&quot;)</p><p>Somewhere between those two storm fronts, there is a peaceful place of knowing that the way you look is just fine, and that a bit of society-informed, fashionable grooming and tweaking is ALSO just fine. Who knows, maybe in Elizabethan times I, too, would have plucked my eyebrows away completely. I know that following arbitrary beauty standards is about fitting in. And that&#39;s ok! I <i>want</i> to fit in - <i>to a point</i>. I sincerely hope that if ever at a crossroad, I would - despite societal pressures - have the personal strength to say FUCK THIS to things like female circumcision or foot binding. Or lip injections. Or bum implants. There <i>is</i> a line - and you get to decide where it is. Where people draw their individual lines creates a bigger picture and changes societal norms. If it feels great: great. If it feels wrong - don&#39;t do it. </p><p>Walk your line wisely, beautifully, and confidently.</p><p></p>","tags":["Beauty","Womanhood"]},{"title":"9 Rules for Smart Herbalist Witches","slug":"9-rules-for-smart-herbalist-witches","short":"How to stay safe during your experiments with herbal remedies. ","long":"<p>The world of herbalism is full of interesting plants that can be used as food or even medicine. It&#39;s exciting and fun to blend your own herbal teas, and it can be really creative and very rewarding. That said, the smart herbaliste doesn&#39;t just randomly through stuff into the cauldrown to see what happens. The smart herbaliste knows what she&#39;s doing.</p><p>Our understanding of the medicinal properties of plants is usually based on what our ancestors have used them for, and there is often merit in the traditional uses of certain herbs after centuries of trial and error. At the same time, scientific evidence for the safety and efficacy of herbal remedies is usually scarce - most of the times, the jury is still out on whether, why and for what a herb might be useful or dangerous. But does that mean you have to shun herbal remedies and food protocols just because your doctor didn&#39;t learn about them in medical school? No. But it does, however, mean, that you need to try things out with your head screwed on. If and when you decide to give a herbal remedy a go, I suggest these common sense safety rules:</p><ol><li><p>Do your research. Before you take anything, you should be able to answer two questions: 1) What exactly are you hoping for this herb to help you with? and 2) What are the reasons you believe this herb will do just that? In the absence of reliable, scientific sources (which are always preferable), look for traditional uses, also across cultures, like Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine. Believe those who reference good sources more than those who just have a pretty blog. Other than that, follow your gut and let common sense pave the way.</p></li><li><p>Try your best to find out if any adverse effects are expected when you take it in small or moderate amounts. Stick with herbs that are &quot;likely safe&quot;. <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/index\">WebMD</a> is a good source for a conservative, sceptical view on herbal medicines (they even dutifully point out that too much <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-960/green-tea\">green tea</a> will kill you), which can be helpful for balancing the blind, pinteresty enthusiasm about this &quot;one herb that will fix all the problems you ever had&quot;.</p></li><li><p>Not everything is good for everyone. Check if a herb you want to try is compatible with your individual constitution, especially if you have any pre-existing conditions. This is particularly true for people with blood pressure issues, autoimmune conditions and hormonal imbalances, to name a few. Not everyone benefits from blood pressure reducing, immune-boosting phytoestrogens (although some probably really do). Be extra-careful during pregnany or when breastfeeding: if in doubt, err on the side of caution.  </p></li><li><p>Check for interactions with other drugs or supplements you might be taking. I found that the <a href=\"https://reference.medscape.com/drug-interactionchecker\">Medscape Drug Interaction Checker</a> is generally my best bet for being knowledgeable about herbal supplements, although as a whole, our knowledge about how herbs interact with pharmacy drugs and with each other is still somewhat limited. Also, let your doctor know about herbs or over-the-counter meds you are taking. </p></li><li><p>Start with a small test dose and see how your body reacts over the next 2-3 days. If you feel fine, it&#39;s probably alright for you to have more of. Increase the dose slowly if you must to the amount you see fit , but...</p></li><li><p>...always stick with amounts that can still be considered food. A cup or two of herbal infusion a day, I would say, is still food. Incorporating a herb in your meals is also obviously food. If you&#39;re taking herbs in capsules or tablets or eating amounts of it that most people would find strange, you&#39;re likely above food-amount level. Of course you can still do this, but I really would not recommend going it alone - talk it through with a doctor or naturopath.</p></li><li><p>If you suspect that a herb or herbal mixture causes you discomfort: stop taking it! Don&#39;t buy into detox myths about feeling worse before you feel better. Effects like that do exist (e.g. with the treatment of <a href=\"https://patient.info/doctor/jarisch-herxheimer-reaction\">some bacterial infections</a> or during substance withdrawal), but that sort of stuff firmly belongs into professional hands. Unless you&#39;re kicking your caffeine habit, don&#39;t assume that something that feels bad is good for you. It&#39;s dangerous and not very smart. </p></li><li><p>Don&#39;t take any herbal remedy for longer than half a year without a break, even if it is just at food-amount levels, unless a doctor specifically tells you to, or gives you green light. </p></li><li><p>If you are ever in any doubt, ask a real human with real knowledge, not the internet. Looking for a good doctor or naturopath who can evaluate your individual situation, with whom you can speak openly and who understands the merits and limits of plant therapy, or even a knowledgable pharmacist, is a worthwhile endeavour. </p></li></ol><p>So much for safety. But how do you know if it&#39;s working? The scientifically minded among you might like to keep a diary that details what you took and track any health issue that you are taking the remedy for. This way, you can see if it actually improves with your use of the herb. The quick &amp; dirty approach is to just be vigilant and notice how you feel. Sometimes, changes can come about in baby steps, so it&#39;s good to look back and compare your situation with how it was a month, 3 months, or half a year ago.</p><p>With all that health and safety taken care of, let&#39;s get stuck in, witches!</p>","tags":["Health"]},{"title":"How to play","slug":"how-to-play","short":"There are no hard and fast rules to each Challenge - the idea is that you make it your own and have fun with it!
