I&#39;m not even talking about shoulder pads, mom pants, perms and plateau shoes: even a few years back, the stereotypical phrase for a woman trying on new clothes was a fearful &quot;does my ass look big in this?&quot; A few years later it seems asses can&#39;t be big enough.</p><p>\nQueen Elizabeth the First wanted to be pale AF and didn&#39;t like the idea of eyebrows. So off with the unsightly caterpillars and on with the skin-eating, cancer-causing white lead face paint. Nowadays, a bronzed glow and rather impressive eyebrows are en vogue, so on with the spray tan and dark eyebrow powders. It seems that beauty is whatever we all agree it is, as longs as it takes some doing for most people. Maybe that&#39;s one reason why hairy legs are not bound to make a comeback in mainstream beauty anytime soon - it would be too easy. </p><p>\nUsually, beauty standards are dictated by style icons like Elizabeth I or Kim K, if their contemporaries view them as copy-worthy. It has something to do with social status; the moment you realise this, you understand: beauty is not all that eternal, but really more of a social concept. It may be rooted in some genetically encoded preferences (looking young, fertile, healthy, strong), but how these attributes are being signalled can - and does - change over time and with location. </p><p>\nI know that being hairless, big-lipped, big-hipped, with a flat tummy, toned limbs, shiny hair and silky skin is all very &quot;now&quot;. I can reject this and pretend to live in a Peter Paul Rubens painting, and Lord knows I&#39;ve tried that approach. But we are all social creatures in a social context, whether we like it or not. I have realised this: even though I understand beauty standards are arbitrary, I cannot easily change them in my head. I, too, like the look of smooth skin, big lips and the rest, even if my feminist side gives me gip for it. Yes, I can grow my leg hair out and strut my dimply thighs in a miniskirt. But at best - and I am speaking only for myself - I can arrive at a place of &quot;I don&#39;t care what people think&quot;. I can&#39;t help it, I feel prettier with smooth skin on my legs. This is the way of my society, and I am a part of it. </p><p>But does this mean I obsess over the differences between my body and that of a photoshopped model or instagram starlet? HELL NO. I am a social being, yes, but I am also an individual with respect for my own unique body. I am also more than just my looks; sometimes life gets in the way of shaving and grooming, and I don&#39;t have to be perfect all the time. Even though I know my preferences are inextricably imbued by the preferences of my society, I still get to make some choices. It was never a goal of mine to look like a model. I even find the goal of &quot;my best self&quot; too much pressure. Instead, I reframed beauty for myself into <b>body confidence</b>. Knowing that beauty emanates from health and state of mind, and that all the rest is just trimmings. For me, it means balancing happily on a fine line, right where the pressure of unrealistic billboard perfection clashes with the pressure of feminist empowerment (&quot;You should feel beautiful regardless of what you look like! Why don&#39;t you?! Why do you give into their norms?!&quot;)</p><p>Somewhere between those two storm fronts, there is a peaceful place of knowing that the way you look is just fine, and that a bit of society-informed, fashionable grooming and tweaking is ALSO just fine. Who knows, maybe in Elizabethan times I, too, would have plucked my eyebrows away completely. I know that following arbitrary beauty standards is about fitting in. And that&#39;s ok! I <i>want</i> to fit in - <i>to a point</i>. I sincerely hope that if ever at a crossroad, I would - despite societal pressures - have the personal strength to say FUCK THIS to things like female circumcision or foot binding. Or lip injections. Or bum implants. There <i>is</i> a line - and you get to decide where it is. Where people draw their individual lines creates a bigger picture and changes societal norms. If it feels great: great. If it feels wrong - don&#39;t do it. </p><p>Walk your line wisely, beautifully, and confidently.</p><p></p>","tags":["Beauty","Womanhood"]}}}
