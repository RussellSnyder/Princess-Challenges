To get you started, here are some suggestions for how to play.","long":"<p><u>Solo player</u></p><p>The goal is to check off all fields within a set number of days (see below). Some activities need repetition for allowing the field to be checked off – this is indicated by the number of check boxes in each field. You can only check off one small check box in a field per day (e.g. eating 3 apples per day still only gets you to check off <i>one</i> box in the “eat an apple” field). </p><p><u>Multi-player</u></p><p>There are different options:</p><ol><li><p> <b>First past the post:</b> the first player to complete the board wins. </p></li><li><p><b>Bingo:</b> the first player to complete a row or column wins.  </p></li><li><p><b>On point: </b>everyone agrees on a time frame (see below); the player who has completed the most fields within that time wins. </p></li></ol><p>You could also play in teams, have leaderboards, open a whatsapp chat to post your achievements, ... have fun with it!</p><p>Some challenges are more personal than others. The LITTLE BRIAR ROSE, for example, is a time of recovery, and the very nature of that doesn&#39;t jibe with a multiplayer competition. </p><p>The Disney-inspired challenges, on the other hand, are great multiplayer options. You could rally up some friends and do it together, you don&#39;t even all have to be on the same challenge - one can go for BEACH PEACH, the other for the MERMAID challenge and so on. </p><p><u>Time frame</u> <u>recommendations</u></p><p><b>Relaxed</b>: 30-31 days</p><p><b>Driven</b>: 21 days</p><p><b>Laser-focussed</b>: 14 days</p><p>Pro-Tip: What‘s in the diary is more likely to happen. Put all the challenge tasks into your calendar and shuffle them around as necessary to fit them into your life comfortably. Happy playing!</p>","tags":[]}}}
