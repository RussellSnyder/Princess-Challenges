stay safe during your experiments with herbal remedies. ","long":"<p>The world is full of interesting plants that can be used as food or even medicine. It&#39;s exciting and fun to blend your own herbal teas, and it can be really creative and very rewarding. That said, the smart herbaliste doesn&#39;t just randomly throw stuff into the cauldrown to see what happens. The smart herbaliste knows what she&#39;s doing.</p><p>Our understanding of the medicinal properties of plants is usually based on what our ancestors have used them for, and there is often merit in the traditional uses of certain herbs after centuries of trial and error. At the same time, scientific evidence for the safety and efficacy of herbal remedies is usually scarce - most of the times, the jury is still out on whether, why and for what a herb might be useful - or dangerous. But does that mean you have to shun herbal remedies and food protocols just because your doctor didn&#39;t learn about them in medical school? No. But it does mean that you need to try things out with your head screwed on. If and when you decide to give a herbal remedies a go, I suggest these common sense safety rules:</p><ol><li><p>Do your research. Before you take anything, you should be able to answer two questions: 1) What exactly are you hoping for this herb to help you with? and 2) What are the reasons you believe this herb will do just that? In the absence of reliable, scientific sources (which are always preferable), look for traditional uses, also across cultures, like Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine. Believe those who reference good sources more than those who just have a pretty blog. Other than that, follow your gut and let common sense pave the way.</p></li><li><p>Try your best to find out if any adverse effects are expected when you take it in small or moderate amounts. Stick with herbs that are &quot;likely safe&quot;. <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/index\">WebMD</a> is a good source for a conservative, sceptical view on herbal medicines (they even dutifully point out that too much <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-960/green-tea\">green tea</a> will kill you), which can be helpful for balancing the blind, pinteresty enthusiasm about &quot;this one herb that will fix all the problems you ever had&quot;.</p></li><li><p>Not everything is good for everyone. Check if a herb you want to try is compatible with your individual constitution, especially if you have any pre-existing conditions. This is particularly true for people with blood pressure issues, autoimmune conditions and hormonal imbalances, to name a few. Not everyone benefits from blood pressure reducing, immune-boosting phytoestrogens (although some probably really do). Be extra-careful during pregnancy or when breastfeeding: if in doubt, err on the side of caution.  </p></li><li><p>Check for interactions with other drugs or supplements you might be taking. I found that the <a href=\"https://reference.medscape.com/drug-interactionchecker\">Medscape Drug Interaction Checker</a> is generally my best bet for being knowledgeable about herbal supplements, although as a whole, our knowledge about how herbs interact with pharmacy drugs and with each other is still pretty limited. Also, let your doctor know about herbs or over-the-counter meds you are taking. </p></li><li><p>Start with a small test dose and see how your body reacts over the next 2-3 days. If you feel fine, it&#39;s probably alright for you to have more of. Increase the dose slowly to the amount you see fit , but...</p></li><li><p>...always stick with amounts that can still be considered food. A cup or two of herbal infusion a day, I would say, is still food. Incorporating a herb in your meals is also obviously food. If you&#39;re taking herbs in capsules or tablets or eating amounts of it that most people would find strange, you&#39;re likely above food-amount level. Of course you can still do this, but I really would not recommend going it alone - talk it through with a doctor or a no-nonsense naturopath.</p></li><li><p>If you suspect that a herb or herbal mixture causes you discomfort: stop taking it! Don&#39;t buy into detox myths about feeling worse before you feel better. Effects like that do exist (e.g. with the treatment of <a href=\"https://patient.info/doctor/jarisch-herxheimer-reaction\">some bacterial infections</a> or during substance withdrawal), but that sort of stuff firmly belongs into professional hands. Unless you&#39;re kicking your caffeine habit, don&#39;t assume that something that feels bad is good for you. It&#39;s dangerous and not very smart. </p></li><li><p>Don&#39;t take any herbal remedy for longer than half a year without a break, even if it is just at food-amount levels, unless a doctor specifically tells you to, or gives you green light. </p></li><li><p>If you are ever in any doubt, ask a real human with real knowledge, not the internet. Looking for a good doctor or naturopath who can evaluate your individual situation, with whom you can speak openly and who understands the merits and limits of plant therapy, or even a knowledgable pharmacist, is a worthwhile endeavour. </p></li></ol><p>So much for safety. But how do you know if it&#39;s working? The scientifically minded among you might like to keep a diary that details what you took and track any health issue or performance parameter that you are taking the remedy for. This way, you can see if it actually improves with your use of the herb. The quick &amp; dirty approach is to just be vigilant and notice how you feel. Sometimes, changes can come about in baby steps, so it&#39;s good to look back and compare your situation with how it was a month, 3 months, or half a year ago.</p><p>With all that health and safety taken care of, let&#39;s get stuck in, witches!</p>","tags":["Health"]},{"title":"Health is not the endgame","slug":"health-is-not-the-endgame","long":"<p>I am a health psychologist.

You&#39;ve probably heard the saying: &quot;A healthy person has a thousand wishes, a sick person has only one&quot;. If you think about it, being healthy is not a goal in itself, but it is the key to a thousand things that you would *really* want to do, experience, be.

Even so, it may sound drastic at first, but it’s really not that difficult, because it’s done overnight. That means, for example, if you finish dinner at 7pm, you can have <i>break-fast </i>any time after 7am the next day. Doable, right? I have found that that kind of fasting pattern works best for me. I&#39;m naturally a late breakfast-eater: it means I wait until I&#39;m actually hungy, which is rarely the case right after getting up; but even so, I don&#39;t like pushing my fasts past the point where my body tells me it&#39;s time to fuel up for the day. So what it means for me is basically just eliminating midnight-snacking and setting an incentive for earlier dinners. And honestly, it&#39;s probaby how your great-grandma lived anyway, without calling it fancy names or or making a big hoo-ha about it. In that sense, a 12-hour fast is not really anything new or dubious. You can go for longer fasting periods if you like, but that is not for everyone, and 12 hours is all you need to tick the box in the challenge.</p><h6>So why do it in the first place?</h6><p>The main reason for doing IM is to you give your body a break from digesting food all the time, so it can get to repairing and renewing more - especially the pipes and bags involved in digestion. Depending on your individual condition, this could mean fewer digestive problems, better skin, less inflammation. Oh, and it can also bring down insulin levels, which means your body can finally access some of the stubborn cushy fat pillows it may have been sitting on for a while (if you have those). </p><h6>Fasting caveats</h6><p>If for any reason even 12 hours of going without food seems too much for you, start out with 10 hours or less and work your way up. It should feel easy and natural after a while. Do whatever works for you, and be sure to consult a healthcare professional if you have diabetes (beware of hypoglycaemia), a history of eating disorders (it might trigger harmful old patterns) or any other condition that you are unsure about in terms of its compatibility with short periods of fasting. Also, listen to your body, and don&#39;t push through at any cost - the idea is to do yourself a favour, not chastise yourself - have an apple at hand just in case. But really, if you look at the intermittent fasting community online (there seems to be a community for anything nowadays), 12 hours is vanilla. Some might not even consider it a true fast because it&#39;s not long enough (but who cares). </p><h6>Some tips:</h6><ul><li><p>Be sure to eat well and healthy amounts during the day, so by the time you start your fast your body had a full day&#39;s worth of nourishment, and you feel satisfied. </p></li><li><p>Water and natural, calorie-free drinks like (herbal) tea are not only allowed during a fasting period but encouraged - hydrate to your heart&#39;s (and body&#39;s) desire! </p></li><li><p>Caffeine is technically fine (as long as you take it without calories, i.e. black tea or coffee), but I found that I feel better when I pair my caffeine with calories (like plant milk or a bit of food). Also, since the bulk of my waking fast hours are in the evening, for me, caffeine during a fast is out. </p></li><li><p>A nice, warm cup of herbal tea is beautifully soothing for the stomach on a fast. My favourite for that purpose is Maharishi Ayurveda&#39;s Vata Tea. It contains liquorish root which makes it naturally sweet and does a great job of taming late night treat cravings.</p></li><li><p>Don&#39;t plan a fast when you have social dates in the calendar (meeting friends, going out, vacations...) or when you have to work late. The former will likely (and rightfully) give you FOMO and make you a buzzkill, and the latter will probably add to your stress and undermine your performance. There is a time and place for fasting, and it&#39;s not all the time everywhere. </p></li><li><p>Enjoy your fasting evenings. Kick back, watch something cool, read a good book, do something you like doing, pamper yourself, call a friend, snuggle up to someone who smells good. There are a millions  things to do in the world other than eating. Get immersed in something wonderful and forget about everything else for a while. </p></li><li><p>Enjoy your breakfast! :)</p></li></ul><p></p>","tags":["Nutrition & Hydration"]},{"title":"Sugarfree days","slug":"sugarfree-days","short":"Sugar is a fickle friend, you know this as well as I do. Adding sugar to your food every day will get in the way of a hot bum and will probably also not help you with anything else you want in life. That is why most Challenges include sugar-free days.","long":"<p>I&#39;m not gonna get too deep into all the ways in which having too much sugar too often can mess with you. You know what they are, from slightly unsightly cosmetic niggles (excess weight, unclear skin...) to downright dangerous medical issues like diabetes and inflammation. No-one wants any of that, but at the same time, we&#39;re hard-wired to love that sweet taste. And that is ok! There are plenty of healthy(ish) ways to enjoy sweet foods: there is fruit, homemade cakes &amp; lemonades, good chocolate and so on. I firmly believe that a good way of eating must satisfy all your tastebuds, and even if you commit to sugar-fee days (or weeks, or longer), in the end, it is balance that wins you the game, not ascetisism. A stable weight and health will also tolerate the odd &quot;naughty&quot; sugary treat - no probs. </p><h6><u>Why have sugarfree days?</u></h6><p>What nobody gets away with untainted, though, is habitual excessive daily sugar consumption. If you&#39;re trying to get fitter, heal, or just generally feel better, sugarfree days can be very helpful. They can make you realise how much and how often you are eating sugar, and help you exercise the discipline to not always have to have it. For example, if you have a bad chocolate craving and you manage to eat a big juicy pear instead, I&#39;d call that an epic win on both the physical and psychological level. Maybe tomorrow is a non-sugarfree day, have the chocolate then. Maybe plan it so you can enjoy a treat in fun company instead of alone and in front of the telly. A little bit of well-dosed, loving discipline is a good thing, I&#39;d say. It&#39;s also good to know that your body does not need refined sugar at all. There is literally no benefit to having it (other than the nom-factor), at lots of benefit to reducing it.</p><h6><u>What counts as &quot;sugar&quot; on a sugarfree day?</u></h6><p>What counts as sugar on a sugar-free day is a blurry line – even carrots contain sugar! But if you were to sytematically NOT have anything that contains natural sugars, you&#39;d deprive yourself of some of the most healthful and delicious foods, you&#39;d diminish the variety of healthy foods you can have (and variety is awesome and important). Unless you&#39;re deliberately going for some low-carb/keto kinda thang, foregoing any and all sugars would be nonsense and counterproductive (imho). That said, if you&#39;re bingeing on fruit sugars and natural sweeteners, you&#39;re kinda missing the point, too. So for sugarfree days on the challenge, you can make up your own rules or stick with the guidelines that I set for myself and that work for me:</p><ul><li><p><b>Fresh</b> fruit doesn’t count as sugar, <b>dried</b> fruit does, because it concentrates the sugar. Yes, some types of fruit have way more sugar than others, but if you are craving mango, have some fresh mango if berries just don&#39;t hit the spot. Yes, too much fruit sugar is also quite bad, but don&#39;t break out your calculator over nutrient tables - just enjoy 1 or 2 portions a day of fruits you love and move on with your life.</p></li><li><p><b>Eating</b> fruit and veggies (like beets, carrots) doesn’t count as sugar, <b>drinking</b> them (juice, smoothies) does. This is not only because the simple act of chewing is pretty important when it comes to digestion, but also  because a lot of the fiber in the fruit gets broken down or even removed in the juicing or blending process, which means that the contained sugar hits your bloodstream faster, and you also need more to feel satisfied and full - which in turn means you&#39;ll likely consume much more sugar than you would have done eating chunks of the same type of fruit. Lemon &amp; lime juice are the obvious exception to that rule.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Honey, maple syrup, molasses, agave nectar and the likes all count as sugar. Especially the first three are usually good replacements for refined sugar in homemade cakes, sweets and drinks, but they are still very high in (naturally occuring) sugar, so having them on a sugar-free day would be cheating.</p></li><li><p>Obviously, added sugar in all its forms counts as sugar, regardless of marketing spins (“evaporated cane juice” – you‘re not fooling us!). If an ingredient ends with -ose, chances are, it&#39;s a sugar (fructose, glucose, dextrose, lactose...); if in doubt, google it. Check your bottled sauces and condiments, seasoning mixes etc, and save visits to fast food chains for another day (or for never). </p></li><li><p>On a sugar-free day, I wouldn&#39;t count the sugar naturally found in milk products (as long as there is no extra sugar added). That said, if your digestion is often sub-optimal, with stinky farts, bloating, diarrhea and so on, or if your skin is prone to breakouts, you could try leaving out dairy from your diet for a while to see if this makes a difference at all. For some people, it&#39;s precisely the dairy sugar (especially the lactose) that can cause trouble. </p></li></ul><p>Obviously, these guidelines are for people who are generally healthy. Lowering your sugar intake is a great idea for almost anyone, but maybe not <i>everyone</i>. If in doubt, talk to you doctor. That said, the sugarfree day is NOT a low-carb day, so as long as you have a healthy amount of high-quality carbohydrate-rich foods in your day, like sweet potatoes, pumpkin, potatoes, root veggies, grains and pseudograins your body likes, I would only anticipate positive effects of a sugarfree day - except maybe the infamous cravings. And the whole idea is to show those who&#39;s boss.</p><h6><u>About artifical sweeteners</u></h6><p>Humans are smart, and some smart humans think they can outsmart sugar and cheat dessert; have their cake and eat it, too; or rather, do a trick on the treat. If something seems too good to be true it usually is, and so it is with no-calorie (&quot;non-nutritive&quot;) sweeteners.</p><p>My general rule is: if a sweetener has no calories, I don&#39;t eat it. No-calorie sweeteners might save you calories the moment you eat them instead of real sugar, but they will make it harder for you to lose weight or keep it off in the long run, since <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2900484/\">they make you eat more later and drive up your insulin levels</a> (even stevia does this!). High insulin levels result in weight gain or difficulty losing it. Now, I don&#39;t want to demonise stevia, especially if it comes in its unprocessed leaf-form (I had some on my balcony in the past!); if it happens to be in a tea blend, I might just have it, although this is rare. I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to add it to my diet, and certainly not as a white powder, because it&#39;s not aligned with my goals. If I wanted to <i>gain</i> weight, I&#39;d probably use it more often.</p><p>My one true exception to my no-non-caloric sweeteners rule is liqorish root. I really enjoy the taste of it in the occasional cup of herbal infusion, but up until writing this blog post, I never thought of it as a sugar replacement. It pretty much never takes that role since it has such a strong taste of its own. I don&#39;t know if it also has the insulin-raising effect that stevia has, I couldn&#39;t find any evidence for or against that. But it stands to reason that it might. Either way, anyone should consume liquorish in moderation to avoid side effects, but unless you binge on it or take supplements, a little bit here and there is &quot;<a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-881/licorice\">likely safe for most people</a>&quot;<a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-881/licorice\"></a>. You get to make your own decisions about what works for you (and whether you like the taste in the first place)!</p><p>Xylitol and other sugar alcohols seem popular in the low carb / keto scene. They occur naturally in some fruits and plants in small quantities. However, extracting them as white powder makes them a processed sweetener, too, and consuming that powder in large quantities to replace sugar seems to cause <a href=\"https://crunchybetty.com/xylitol-should-we-stop-calling-it-natural/\">digestive trouble</a> for some - in fact, all no-calorie sweeteners seem to have a laxative effect if you only have a large enough amount. There is also controversy with how xylitol &amp; co. are made, but I don&#39;t want to get into that. For myself, I have decided not to bother with sugar alcohols. You might feel different.</p><p>One thing, though, is pretty clear to me: artificial sweeteners (aspartame, acesulfame &amp; friends) are bad; <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5617129/\">aspartame might make you feel depressed</a>, and that&#39;s not even all. If you search through scientific publications, you&#39;ll find plenty more cause for concern, but honestly, who cares about the details? Just don&#39;t have them and be happy. I find this particularly easy since I think they taste repulsive, too. &quot;No added sugar&quot; on a label can be code for &quot;lots of added sweeteners&quot;. Also,  if a product proudly presents itself as <i>Diet</i> or <i>Light</i>, be wary. It&#39;s likely part of the scam that has obesity rates soaring. Instead, join team &quot;real deal&quot; and enjoy your sugar in healthy moderation, from good sources and without shame.</p><h6><u>How to make sugarfree days easy on yourself</u></h6><ul><li><p>You may find that one sugar-free day at a time is not enough to make sugar cravings subside.

It is, however, an item that is strongly associated with the character it is alluding to: the witch. </p><p>Those of you who read my post about the Wise Wild Woman know how difficult it was for me to find the perfect icon for a challenge that has at its core womanhood, women&#39;s health, in a grounded, shameless, enlightened, unconventional and loving way. It was triggered by my diagnosis of endometriosis, and the insight that excruciating period pain is <i>not</i> normal. The diagnosis felt like a much-needed validation, I wasn&#39;t overly sensitive all those years, and I also wasn&#39;t &quot;unlucky&quot; with my menstruation, I was physically ill and needed appropriate medical attention (which, at last, I received, thank God). </p><p>What ensued, and is still ensuing, is a quest to keep my belly healthy, happy and endo-free, and, more broadly speaking, finding a wholesome sense of health that honours my being a woman. That process calls into question a lot of the beliefs and practices that I never really stopped to think about. Some people say we don&#39;t have to have periods to be healthy and fertile - is that true? Are bleached tampons making people sick without them knowing? What role might cannabis play in women&#39;s health? Is it true or bullshit that the moon has an impact on your cycle? Which menstruation products are actually available, though maybe not from your local drug store? Does using menstrual blood for art make you a beacon of femininity or a disgusting weirdo? What alternatives are there to painkillers? Oh, and while we&#39;re at it, is female ejaculation real?</p><p>In a mostly (but not totally) non-sexual way, all of this sparked a new interest in my female parts. The last time I felt this way, I was a teenager, being full of questions. The questions I had back then have been answered a long time ago - how to use a tampon, how to deal with period pain, how the cycle works, how to avoid pregnancy, and so on. But why stop at the basics? There is a whole world of knowledge and vagina/womb-related hacks and wisdom out there that I feel like I could have examined and experimented with a long time ago. It&#39;s time for the MAGIC CAULDRON Quest.</p><p> A magic cauldron is where interesting things are brewing, hidden from sight. It&#39;s the instrument with which the witch works her magic (and probably also cooks her soup for dinner... it&#39;s can&#39;t always be all woo woo). This quest is about caring for the cauldron so you can use it the way you please. It&#39;s also a symbol for the witch herself, the savage sage who, like I laid out before, is an image of female power and knowledge, defamed during centuries of oppressive patriarchy. The reason I didn&#39;t want to call this quest &quot;the witch challenge&quot; is because the classic fairytale witch is still strongly associated with the devil and eating children, and I want to distance myself very clearly from endorsing any and all acts of evil, occultism and related nonsense. &quot;The good witch&quot; is also not a great character name, since the modern &quot;good&quot; witch is usually a young and sexy city-dweller and therefore too far emoved from being a wise old lady in the woods - and I don&#39;t want to give up that image: a nature-dwellling, experienced, self-willed but highly peculiar woman in a cosy little hut with all sorts of outlandish things in and around it. So, I decided to stop the hunt for a character and settle for one of her signature items; incidentally, the MAGIC CAULDRON also serves as a fun metaphor for the womb and it neighbouring structures. It might even be possible to &quot;cook up&quot; a tiny human in it! If that&#39;s not magic, I don&#39;t know what is. </p><p>The MAGIC CAULDRON quest has the duration of at least one menstrual cycle, however long it may be. You can start at any point in your cycle, and it&#39;s over when you have bled twice. This way, you get time to delve into the MAGIC CAULDRON world and prepare things you want to try when your period rolls around, and then you get to consciously live through a whole cycle. You&#39;ll get to pay loving attention to your body and mind, connecting with nature and hopefully having a blast experimenting with all sorts of ways to make you enjoy your cycle more, from bud to blood. And why not? Half of all humanity lives with this cyclical process for most of their lives. If you&#39;re one of those humans, wouldn&#39;t you say it&#39;s worth checking in with on occasion? </p><p>This challenge is for you if you: </p><ul><li><p>have painful or irregular periods you want to improve</p></li><li><p>have great periods, but want to be more in tune with your cycle</p></li><li><p>like the idea of a challenge with an unapologetic adult female focus </p></li><li><p>want to try out new things &quot;down there&quot; </p></li><li><p>love fairytales and stories about witches</p></li><li><p>are interested in herbalism</p></li><li><p>love nature and science</p></li><li><p>are generally a curious woman</p></li><li><p>don&#39;t equate feminism with man-hating and bra-burning, but with giving female topics the attention they deserve and with seeing to it that being a woman is a good experience for yourself and others</p></li></ul><p>So, if you&#39;re in: let&#39;s get the fire going and show some love to that black pussy cat...</p><p></p>","tags":["Womanhood","Health"]}]}}}
